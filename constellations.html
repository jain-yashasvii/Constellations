             A group of stars that looks like a particular shape in the sky and has been given a name. 
             These stars are far away from Earth. They are not connected to each other at all.
             Some stars in a constellation might be close while others are very far away. But, if you were to 
             draw lines in the sky between the stars like a dot-to-dot puzzle and use lots of imagination the 
             picture would look like an object, animal, or person.<br>
             Over time, cultures around the world have had different names and numbers of constellations depending 
             on what people thought they saw. Today, there are 88 officially recognized constellations.

            <body style="color:white;"> <p>Some of the most well-known constellations from both the Northern and Southern hemispheres are:<br>
                 Ursa Major, Cassiopeia, Orion, Canis Major, Centaurus, Crux, and Carina</p>

                 Ursa Major, also known as the Great Bear, is the third-largest constellation in the sky and the largest constellation in the Northern Hemisphere.<br>
                 It includes the Big Dipper asterism and is one of the most recognizable collections of stars in the Northern Hemisphere. <br>
                 The Big Dipper is made up of seven bright stars that form the shape of a ladle or dipper.

            <body style="color:white;">
                 Cassiopeia is home to five bright stars that form the W shape. Some describe these stars as outlining the chair or throne she sits upon. 
                 If you are viewing Cassiopeia as the letter W, the stars, from left to right, are Segin, Ruchbah, Gamma Cassiopeiae, Schedar and Caph.<br>
                 Cassiopeia is opposite the Big Dipper in the northern sky. That is, the two constellations lie on opposite sides of the pole star, Polaris.

                 Orion the Hunter is arguably the most recognizable constellation in the world. Orion lies on the celestial equator, making it visible from
                 both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Orion’s shape is easy to pick out because of its many bright stars and signature Orion’s Belt:
                 three stars close together in a nearly straight line.

                 constellation Canis Minor. Canis Major is home to Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, and to the red hypergiant VY Canis Majoris, one of the largest stars known.

                   Carina means the keel or bottom of a ship. This constellation was originally part of a larger pattern representing an entire sailing ship. 
                     The ship is now three separate constellations: Carina the Keel, Vela the Sails, and Puppis the Stern. Carina contains the second brightest star
                     in the night sky, Canopus, along with several other notable bright stars, among them Eta Carinae, surrounded by the famous Carina Nebula.
